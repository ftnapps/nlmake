This NLMake 1.13cb is a port of NLMake 1.13wb (available on ftp.nwstar.com)
to the following platforms and compilers:

nlmk-dos.exe DOS     MS Visual C++ 1.5 (16-bit)
nlmake16.exe DOS     Borland BC++ 4.5
nlmake32.exe WIN32   Borland BC++ 4.5
linux/nlmake LINUX   GNU gcc

The original makefiles from NLMake 1.13wb are archived in the old-make dir

Any configuration files included with this package are samples only and
segments have been renamed so as not to match those in actual use at 1:12/0.

This copy of NLMake is a port but not a fix for any of the known problems
and may have added bugs; it still shows most or all of the following errors:

 - MinPhone will require exactly that number of parts, no more, no less
   Disabling MinPhone entirely from the nlmake.ctl file is a workaround

 - NLMake handles perceived errors in individual entries by using ;E to
   disable the node from the list, instead of using last-known-good segments

 - The date of the previous week's list (for diff generation) was determined
   incorrectly for much of the beginning of 2001; haven't seen this recently
   so don't know if it was ever fixed or will re-appear at a later date. It
   may also be possible to exceed the maximum line length in the FTSC spec.

 - (fixed) Name of an archived file to be generated is sometimes incorrect;
   a path of ./out/r12-list.089 may get archived to .Aout/r12-list.089 as
   NLMake is taking the first '.' in the path as the start of file .extension

 - The wildcards on flags like ,UMRVIA:* and ,URVIA:* are not being handled
   properly; the flags code is just doing a strstr(quicklst,...) on these
   which treats * no differently from any other ordinary character, then
   attempting a retry with the strings converted to uppercase (fails same way)
   There are some flags (like G*) hardcoded into flags.c but this isn't a fix.
   Downlinks may receive spurious warnings when using ,URVIA:1:net/node flags.

 - I suspect that some errors in submitted segments are not spotted in TEST
   mode but are only flagged when running ./nlmake /p (need to verify this)
   DOS/Win32 versions of the code appear to always be running in PROCESS mode.

 - The submission of diff files (instead of complete segments) by downlinks
   has not been tested on the linux version.
